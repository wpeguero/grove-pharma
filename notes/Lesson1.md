# Where in the Genome Does Replication Begin?
## 1.1 A Journey of a Thousand Miles...
- **Replication origin**
    - Location where replications begins.
    - Also known or denoted as *ori*.
    - This is found within the *genomic region*.

- **DNA Polymerases**
    - Enzymes used to replicate DNA.
    - **used within the replication origin

- **viral vectors**
    - Genetically engineered mini-genomes.
    - Used for gene therapy.
    - Possess ability to penetrate the cell wall.
    - carries artificial genes.

### STOP and Think Section
The Problem: Assume that a genome has a single *ori* and is represented as a DNA string (A sequence of nucleotides from the four-letter alphabett {A, C, G, T}).

**The Input**: A DNA string Genome.
**The Output**: The location of ori in Genome

**Question**: *Does this biological problem represent a clearly stated computational problem?*

**Response**: *This problem does not represent a computational problem. The solution involves the discovery of the *ori* or *replication origin*. This location can be found through a number of techniques depending on the type of DNA (i.e. bacterial vs chromosomal). Because of the aforementioned, the problem is not clearly defined. The discovery of the replication origin is complex.*
